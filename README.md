# Mine Game

This is a game that allows users to place bombs down on various locations in order to defeat the enemies. The code determines the positions the user must 
place in order to win and then creates the enemies based on that. This game requires problem solving skills to complete the levels, 
as they get more difficult as you progress.

## To Play
* Select a difficulty and then you will be in the game main menu.
* Use arrow keys or wasd to move the player (cyan square) and press space to place bombs.
* Bombs will explode in all 8 directions from the position placed once all have been pressed and you will either win or lose based on if you defeat all enemies (red squares).
* Press backspace to remove last placed bomb.
* Press f to place a flag, which can help for keeping track of possible positions.
