# Mine Game

This is a game that allows users to place bombs down on various locations in order to defeat the enemies. The code determines the positions the user must 
place in order to win and then creates the enemies based on that. This game requires problem solving skills to complete the levels, 
as they get more difficult as you progress.


## How I Created This:
**Technology Used:** Python, Pygame

_Discuss more here._

## Optimisations
_Future development will be described here._

## Lessons Learned:
During the creation of this project I learned quite a bit about how to develop games within python using pygame.

I also learnt how to utilize randomisation and backtracking skills.

I am hoping to work more on this project in the future to make it complete entirely to users' satisfaction and attempt to make randomisation 
better using algorithm and AI techniques. Thank You.
